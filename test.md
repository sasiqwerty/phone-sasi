**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Chop the 4 large onions, 7-8 green chilies, and set them aside with the 4 curry leaves.
2. **Cooking Start:** Heat 5 spoons of oil in a pan.
3. **Adding Spices:** Once the oil is hot, add a pinch of cumin seeds. Immediately add the chopped green chilies.
4. **Onions:** Add the chopped onions. Fry them until they turn brown.
5. **Ginger-Garlic Paste:** Once onions are browned, add 2 spoons of ginger garlic paste. Sauté it until the raw smell goes away.
6. **Chicken:** Add the 1 kg of cleaned chicken. Mix well with the onions and ginger-garlic paste.
7. **Seasoning:** Add salt, 2 spoons of red chili powder, 2 spoons of coriander powder, 1 spoon of Garam Masala, and 2 spoons of Cumin Powder. Mix everything well.
8. **Water:** Pour 100 ml of water into the pan (this is because the chicken will also release some water).
9. **Simmer:** Close the pan with a lid and let the chicken boil for 15 minutes on medium flame.
10. **Check:** After 15 minutes, check the chicken. If you prefer a gravy consistency, stop here. For a drier, powdery consistency, proceed to the next step.
11. **Final Fry:** If you want the chicken to have a powdery consistency, fry it on high flame for 5 more minutes.
12. **Garnish:** Add chopped coriander leaves for flavor and presentation.
13. **Taste Test:** Check the taste, and adjust any seasonings if needed. Optionally, you can squeeze some lemon juice over the chicken for added tang.
14. **Serve:** Enjoy the chicken fry with rasam or as it is.
